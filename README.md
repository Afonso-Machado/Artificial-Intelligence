# Backpack Price Prediction

This project demonstrates how to solve a regression problem using basic machine learning models in a Jupyter notebook. The goal is to predict backpack prices based on various features using models such as:

- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forests
- Neural Networks

The data set used was sourced from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/playground-series-s5e2)

## Requirements

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) (Python 3.x)
- The following libraries (already included with Anaconda):
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - SciKit Learn

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Anaconda**

   Download and install Anaconda from the official website: 
   [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

2. **Open a terminal** (Linux/macOS) or **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows).

3. **Activate the Anaconda environment**

   If you're using the default `base` environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate
   ```

4. **(Optional) Install JupyterLab**  
   If JupyterLab is not already installed in your environment:
   ```bash
   conda install jupyterlab
   ```

5. **Launch JupyterLab**
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

> The notebook should already have all code cells with their output displayed, however if this is not the case simply re-running all the cells should give the desired result.
